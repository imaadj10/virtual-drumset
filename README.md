###
#### Case Where Log Would Be Empty:
The log could be empty if the user interacts with the drumset interface but never hits the "Record Track"
button and doesn't interact with any of the track control buttons. If the user never clicks "Record Track", 
they can still click the drumset buttons and play the drumset, but instruments will never be added to the track, 
so nothing gets logged. This is because adding instruments to a track is the add X to Y functionality
of the project, so if this never happens, the log has nothing to show.

## Phase 4: Task 3
One thing that sticks out to me first is that I have some coupling with my VirtualDrumsetApp, VirtualDrumsetPanel,
and my Track classes. Given the chance to refactor I would definitely try to remove that coupling.
Another thing that I notice is in my Drumset class. I have individual methods for each of my different
instruments in my drumset. If I ever wanted to add more instruments it would be difficult with how I
currently have the class set up. I would refactor this so that it gets compacted down to one method that
gets an instrument passed to it if it wants to play that instruments sound. Also, in my VirtualDrumsetPanel
class, I feel like I have a lot of extra functions for setting listeners and styling buttons. I think
moving a lot of these components of the panel into their own classes could have helped clean that code
up a little. Finally, I would move implementation of the playSound() function into my instrument class
and just use the Drumset class to set up my drumset with various instruments.
